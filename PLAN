PLAN


- STORY DRIVEN GAME

- POINT A TO POINT B

- PLATFORMER PUZZLE GAME

- OBJECTIVE IS TO REACH THE OTHER PERSON

- SCREEN GIVES DIRECTION

- MIRROR DIALOGUE

- MINIMALISTIC PIXEL ART

- 10 - 15 LEVELS 
(FIRST FIVE LEVELS ARE REGULAR PLATFORMER LEVELS, 
EACH FIVE LEVELS AFTER ARE MESSED UP/CORRUPTED VERSIONS OF FIRST FIVE. CORRUPTING MORE AS THE GAME GOES ON)

- ARROW KEYS

- ONE ENDING (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)


PROGRAMMING

- LEVELS WILL BE DESIGNED WITH TWO BMPS
 -> ONE BMP IS SOLELY THE BORDERS OF PLATFORMS
 -> THE OTHER IS FOR VISUALS
 
- IN THE GO FILES FOR EACH LEVEL, USE AN ARRAY TO STORE EACH PLATFORM'S INFORMATION

STORY 1
 L > R
 
CHAR 1: CHASER
CHAR 2: CHASEE

FOR THE FIRST 3-5 PUZZLE LEVELS, YOU PLAY THE CHASER. YOU ARE TAUGHT TO ELIMINATE THE CHASEE

FOR PUZZLES 6-8/9, YOU ARE NOW THE CHASEE. YOU GAIN PERSPECTIVE OF THE LIFE/GOAL OF THE CHASEE. TO ESCAPE

FOR LAST PUZZLE, YOU ARE AGAIN THE CHASER

IN THE FINAL STORY LEVEL - YOU HAVE THE CHOICE, CAPTURE CHASEE // LET CHASEE GO

IF YOU CAPTURE CHASEE - YOU BECOME AFFLICTED WITH THE MALWARE, BECOMING THE VIRUS, BEING THE CHASEE IN A NEVER 
ENDING LOOP

IF YOU LET CHASEE GO - YOU END THE LOOP, CHASEE IS FREE





THINGS WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE 

    FUCK THE KEY SYSTEM AND ITS STUPID SHIT

    ummmm probably add some projectiles to make game actually difficult

    ooooo and also i still dont know how to render text onto the screen

    but then yea thats pretty much it

ERRORS AS OF 10:00PM:

    FOR SOME REASON, IT WOULD GO FROM LEVEL 2 to 4 AFTER FINISHING LEVEL 2.
