This is the package we're using

However go get _____ isn't enough. You'll need to actually install it into your directory.

The link should lead you to the installation selection and there you'll get some directoin

Also

main.go isn't done yet so don't worry about running it right now. UPATE: main.go DOES WORK, however its just an empty white tab (which is what was planned)
Test.go does work and does infact open a window.
